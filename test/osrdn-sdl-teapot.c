/*
 * The Utah teapot through SDL2, to find out what SDL2's delivery costs.
 *
 * ONE SOURCE, TWO BINARIES, as the other demo pairs in this workspace are:
 *
 *   sdlteapot_sw       stock libGL.a  + libSDL2.a
 *   sdlteapot_radeon   libGL_radeon.a + libSDL2.a
 *
 * The SDL2 port's GL backend calls OSMesaCreateContext(OSMESA_ARGB, ...) and
 * OSMesaMakeCurrent, which are exactly where this driver substitutes a video
 * memory surface -- so the hybrid binary needs NO change to SDL2 for the card
 * to draw.  Linking one archive instead of the other is the whole difference.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND IT IS NOT SPEED.  SDL2's OPENSTEP_GL_SwapWindow pushes
 * the OSMesa buffer up through AppKit, so with the driver engaged every frame
 * becomes: the card draws into video memory, the driver reads it back into the
 * caller's array, AppKit puts it on the screen.  The sibling window demo in
 * this project reaches 52 fps by NOT doing that -- it presents with the
 * driver's video-memory-to-video-memory blit, 3.69 ms against AppKit's 62.79.
 * The readback was estimated at about 358 ms for 800x600 from an earlier
 * table.  This demo exists to replace that estimate with a measurement, and
 * to say plainly which path each frame took.
 *
 * SO THE OUTPUT IS EVIDENCE, NOT A SCORE.  "It ran the hybrid binary" proves
 * nothing: the driver falls back whenever the device, the mode, the mapping
 * or the surface admission is unavailable, and a fallback still draws a
 * correct teapot at a software speed.  A hardware frame needs the surface
 * claimed, triangles drawn by the card, and batches submitted; and to say
 * WARP drew it you need warp == drawn as well, because trapezoids at nought
 * also describes a total software fallback.
 *
 * THE WINDOW DOES NOT RESIZE.  The driver owns one surface at one size and
 * refuses a different one -- correctly, and silently, by letting the caller
 * render in its own memory.  A resized run would put hardware frames and
 * software frames under a single frame rate.
