# Put the package's identity keys into a machine's instance table.

#   awk -f osrdn-identity-keys.awk Default.table Instance0.table > candidate
#
# THE RULE THIS SERVES.  The machine owns its configuration and the package
# owns the driver's identity.  (Taken from openstep-matrox-remade, where it
# was learned.)  Preserving the whole instance table byte for byte kept an
# operator's Location and switches -- and in the Matrox package also kept a
# development "Version" = "0.5" through that driver's 1.0 and 1.1, so
# Configure showed a version it never shipped as.  The same rule wrote the
# OLD Driver Name back over a renamed bundle, which would have come up with
# no display driver.  Here it matters from the first release: every machine
# that ran the development driver holds "Version" = "0.1".
#
# SIX KEYS, NO MORE.  Auto Detect IDs and Bus Type look like the package's,
# but doc/driverkit.md is explicit that InstanceN.table records the hardware
# as DETECTED AND CONFIGURED -- its example of a working DEC 21041 carries
# Auto Detect IDs inside the instance table.  Those are the machine's record
# of what matched, not our catalogue.  Title is left alone too: what
# Configure shows is Long Name from Localizable.strings, so overwriting
# Title buys nothing and a change that buys nothing is only a risk.
#
# The values come from Default.table rather than the payload's instance
# table, because by the time this runs the restore has already written the
# machine's table over the payload's -- the shipped instance table is gone.
# Default.table is the package's own and survives.
#
# Everything not selected is emitted byte for byte, in place.  No
# delete-and-append: that loses a key's position and any comment around it.
#
# WRITTEN FOR OLD AWK.  OPENSTEP has /bin/awk and nothing else -- no nawk,
# no gawk -- and it is the v7 language.  Three things it does not have, all
# found by running it:
#
#   user-defined functions   "syntax error near line 34"
#   /dev/stderr              same
#   FNR                      SILENT, and much worse: `NR == FNR` is simply
#                            never true, so the first file falls through to
#                            the second rule and Default.table's whole
#                            comment block was copied into the candidate
#
# The last one is why the files are told apart by FILENAME instead.  A
# missing feature that makes a script fail is cheap; one that makes it
# produce plausible garbage is not.
